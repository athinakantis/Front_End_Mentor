### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size

### Links

- [Live Page]()

## My process

I looked at it for a while, and my first approach was to use two grids (Silly, I know). After realizing my mistake, I corrected it so that the main content container is a flexbox and the 3 right columns is in a grid format.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### Continued development

What I want to improve:

- Understanding how best to utilize the minmax function
