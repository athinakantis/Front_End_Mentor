## My process

I looked at it for a while, and my first approach was to use two grids, however later I decided to go with a main container flexbox and the 3 right columns is in a grid format.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### Continued development

What I want to improve:

- Understanding how best to utilize the minmax function
