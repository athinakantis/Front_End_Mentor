# Launch Countdown Timer Solution by Athina Kantis

I decided to do a slightly different take on this challenge as I was inspired by my nieces upcoming birthday and wanted to do something fun leading up to it.<br>
Besides the countdown it shows a fun firework animation that will only render during her birthday<br>

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second (start the count at 14 days)
- **Bonus**: When a number changes, make the card flip from the middle

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

I definitely want to use this project toÂ look at what others have done differently and take something away from that.
